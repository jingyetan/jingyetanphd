Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! If you've found your way here, you're probably wondering what a website about uncertainty quantification has to do with action figures and ramen adventures. Well, let me tell you—it has everything to do with it!

## The "Why" Behind This Site 🤔

<div class="card">
  <p>For the longest time, I struggled with the traditional academic website template. You know the one—sterile CV, list of publications, maybe a stock photo if you're feeling adventurous. But here's the thing: <strong>we're not just our research</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>I realized that some of my best research insights have come from the most unexpected places:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>📸 <strong>Photography</strong> taught me to see patterns and beauty in noise</li>
    <li>🤖 <strong>Building figures</strong> reinforced the importance of precision and patience</li>
    <li>🍜 <strong>Food adventures</strong> reminded me that the best discoveries often happen when you venture outside your comfort zone</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Breaking the Academic Mold 🎨

<div class="card">
  <blockquote>
    "Science is done by humans, and humans are beautifully, wonderfully complex."
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Why should we hide the parts of ourselves that make us unique? My love for street photography doesn't make me less of a statistician—if anything, it makes me <em>better</em> at seeing the world through different lenses (pun absolutely intended).</p>
</div>

## What You'll Find Here 🗺️

This website is my attempt to bridge the professional and personal. Here's what you can expect:

<div class="card-grid">
  <div class="card">
    <h3><span class="emoji">🔬</span>Professional Stuff</h3>
    <p>Yes, there's still the traditional academic content—my research, publications, and professional journey. But presented in a way that (hopefully) doesn't put you to sleep!</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3><span class="emoji">🌈</span>Personal Adventures</h3>
    <p>Photography projects, figure building progress, foodie discoveries, and the stories behind them. Because life is more than just work!</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3><span class="emoji">🤝</span>Real Connections</h3>
    <p>Insights into how my hobbies inform my research, and vice versa. Plus, I'm hoping to connect with fellow researchers who also happen to love great ramen or epic figure builds!</p>
  </div>

## The Technical Side (For My Fellow Nerds) 💻

<div class="card">
  <p>This site is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages—keeping it simple and focused on content. I've added some custom CSS to make it more personal and interactive, because even a static site can have personality!</p>
  
  <p>The design philosophy? <strong>Clean, approachable, and a little bit playful.</strong> Just like I try to make my research.</p>
</div>

## A Living, Breathing Site 🌱

<div class="card">
  <p>This isn't a "set it and forget it" website. I'm planning to regularly update it with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>New research insights and methodologies</li>
    <li>Photography from travels and conferences</li>
    <li>Progress on figure building projects</li>
    <li>Amazing food discoveries (with photos, obviously)</li>
    <li>Thoughts on how all these experiences intersect with my work</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## What's Next? 🚀

<div class="card">
  <p>I'm excited to share more about my work on uncertainty quantification, but also about the uncertain adventures that make life interesting! Whether you're here for the research, the photography, the figures, or the food recommendations—welcome!</p>
  
  <p>And if you're a fellow researcher who also happens to collect vintage figures or know the best hole-in-the-wall noodle shop in your city, <strong>please reach out</strong>! The intersection of professional and personal interests often leads to the most interesting conversations.</p>
