# About Dr. Jingye (Kira) Tan 👋

<div class="card">
  <p>Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet, where uncertainty meets curiosity and data tells stories! 🌟</p>
  
  <p>I'm a researcher who's passionate about making sense of the uncertain world around us. By day, I dive deep into the mathematical foundations of <strong>Uncertainty Quantification</strong>, developing methods that help people make better decisions when they don't have all the answers. By night (and weekends!), you'll find me capturing moments through photography, building intricate action figures, or discovering amazing food in hidden corners of cities around the world.</p>
</div>

## The Professional Side 🎓

<div class="card-grid">
  <div class="card">
    <h3><span class="emoji">🔬</span>Research Philosophy</h3>
    <p>I believe that understanding and quantifying uncertainty isn't just about mathematics—it's about helping people navigate complexity with confidence. My work sits at the intersection of theory and application, always asking: "How can we make this useful for real people facing real problems?"</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3><span class="emoji">🎯</span>What Drives Me</h3>
    <p>Every model tells a story, every uncertainty reveals an opportunity, and every problem is a puzzle waiting to be solved. I'm motivated by the challenge of turning abstract mathematical concepts into tools that make a tangible difference.</p>

## The Human Side 🌈

<div class="card-grid">
  <div class="card">
    <h3><span class="emoji">📸</span>Through the Lens</h3>
    <p>Photography is my meditation. There's something magical about capturing a fleeting moment—the way light hits a building, a genuine smile, or the quiet beauty of an ordinary scene. It teaches me to see patterns and beauty everywhere, skills that surprisingly enhance my research perspective!</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3><span class="emoji">🤖</span>Building Dreams</h3>
    <p>Action figure building might seem like an odd hobby for a statistician, but it's all about precision, patience, and problem-solving—exactly the skills I use in research! Each figure is a small engineering project, and there's incredible satisfaction in seeing all the pieces come together perfectly.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3><span class="emoji">🍜</span>Culinary Explorer</h3>
    <p>Food is my gateway to understanding different cultures and connecting with people. Whether I'm at a conference in a new city or exploring my own neighborhood, I'm always on the hunt for authentic flavors and hidden gems. Some of my best conversations have happened over a shared meal!</p>

## Professional Values & Approach 🌟

<div class="card">
  <blockquote>
    "Good research isn't just about finding the right answer—it's about asking the right questions, being honest about what we don't know, and making our work accessible to those who need it most."
  </blockquote>
  
  <p><strong>What I believe in:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Research should be open, reproducible, and honestly communicated</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> The best insights come from diverse perspectives working together</li>
    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Technical excellence means nothing if it doesn't help solve real problems</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> The field evolves constantly, and staying curious is essential</li>
    <li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> Sharing knowledge and supporting the next generation of researchers</li>
  </ul>
