Welcome to my personal website! I'm excited to share this space where I'll be discussing my work in uncertainty quantification, data science, and statistical modeling.

## What You'll Find Here

This website serves as a hub for my professional activities and thoughts on:

- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Methods, applications, and best practices
- **Statistical Modeling**: Techniques for robust inference and prediction
- **Data Science**: Insights from real-world projects and methodologies
- **Research Updates**: Progress on current projects and collaborations
- **Tutorials and Guides**: Sharing knowledge with the community

## My Journey in Uncertainty Quantification

Uncertainty quantification has become increasingly important in our data-driven world. Whether we're making predictions about climate change, assessing financial risks, or optimizing engineering systems, understanding and quantifying uncertainty is crucial for making reliable decisions.

Through my research and practical work, I've seen how proper uncertainty quantification can transform decision-making processes and lead to more robust, reliable outcomes.

## Looking Forward

I'm planning to regularly share insights, tutorials, and updates about my work. Some upcoming topics include:

- Best practices for uncertainty propagation in complex models
- Case studies in applied uncertainty quantification
- Tools and software for UQ practitioners
- Collaborative research opportunities

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow researchers, practitioners, and anyone curious about uncertainty quantification and data science. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:jt894@cornell.edu) or connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jingyetan).

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing this journey with you!
